This repository containes codebase for my Btech Projects :
1) IOT Based Crowd Detection , Prediction and Avoidance System

  Developed a crowd monitoring system using four vibration sensors placed at the corners of a platform to detect ground vibrations. Increased vibration levels indicate a higher risk of stampedes.
  By analyzing data from the sensors, we identified thresholds for minimum and maximum stampede risk. An alarm system was implemented to alert authorities during overcrowding.
  Additionally, the emergency exit gates can be opened automatically while the entry gate remains closed, using a servo motor for operation.
  The exit gate with emergency exit gates is also opened while the entry gate is closed. The gates are operated by a servo motor. 
Module Used : Arduino Mega 
Programmed in : C++

2) Solar Powered Radar System for Monitoring & Motion Detection:

  Nodemcu is used as the main controller here with which Ultrasonic sensor is connected to detect objects in the range servo motor is attached below the sensor to provide smooth 180 degree moment
  and wide range to the sensor the Radar GUI shows the position of the sensor and its angle whenever a object is detected it shows red color in that particular area on the GUI we can easily 
  detect object's coordinates if the PIR sensor detects a motion then using the ultrasonic sensor's coordinates the intruder will be caught easily , it can be used in restricted zone.

Module Used : Nodemcu 
Programmed in : C++
